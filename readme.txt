ELGG Update Services will check the ELGG's plugin repository and notify the administrators about new plugin releases.
To do: elgg_update_services_file_get_conditional_contents should be a core function or must be placed inside a "framework" plugin. The function, with a different name, is reused in Spam Login Filter plugin.
